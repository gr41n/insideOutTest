# insideOutTest
Haven't quite finished work on this one. It was a tool to automate the process of testing what traffic and data can get from inside of the network, out. Goal was to test the following...

Feature Goals:
- External Port Scan
- External Application Scan (to test application inspection)
- Data Loss Scan (send sensitive files over various methods like web and email...sensitive files will contain PII and such to test  detection)
- Category Scan (test to see what websites are blocked within the network...keep in mind that this probably won't work too well with organizations that have user defined web blocking set up)

Improvement suggestions and feedback is welcome!
